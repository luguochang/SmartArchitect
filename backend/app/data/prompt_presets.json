Analyze the given architecture and suggest refactoring improvements focusing on:\n1) Reducing coupling between services\n2) Introducing appropriate design patterns (e.g., API Gateway, Service Mesh, Event Bus)\n3) Improving scalability and maintainability\n\nMaintain all existing nodes but reorganize connections and add intermediate layers where needed.
